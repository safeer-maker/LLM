# LLM - Language Model Training Repository
This repository contains code for training Language Models (LLMs). Language models play a crucial role in natural language understanding and generation tasks. Here, we provide resources and guidance on training LLMs using various datasets and techniques.

## Contents
###1. Dataset Management
In the Dataset Management section, we focus on working with datasets, a fundamental component of training LLMs. This section covers the following topics:

#### Data Sources: Learn how to fetch datasets from various sources such as GitHub repositories, archives, The-Eye, and the Hugging Face dataset library.

#### Data Preprocessing: Understand how to preprocess datasets and tokenize them for model training. Effective data preprocessing is essential for preparing high-quality input for your models.

#### Creating Custom Datasets: Explore how to create custom datasets from scratch. This can be particularly useful when working with specialized or domain-specific data.

#### Handling Large Datasets: Discover strategies for efficiently handling large datasets, including streaming techniques to optimize memory usage.

### 2. Model Training
In the Model Training section, we delve into the process of training LLMs using a popular model architecture like BERT (bert-base-uncased). This section covers the following aspects:

#### Fine-Tuning: Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained language model with your dataset. Fine-tuning is a critical step to adapt a pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains.

#### Training Techniques: Explore different training techniques, including using the Hugging Face Trainer API and leveraging the PyTorch library for training.

#### Accelerated Training: Understand how to utilize hardware accelerators to expedite the training process, making it faster and more efficient.

By following the guidance and resources provided in this repository, you can gain valuable insights into training powerful LLMs that can be applied to a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

Feel free to explore the subdirectories and documentation within this repository to get started with your LLM training journey. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to our community for support and collaboration.

Happy training!
