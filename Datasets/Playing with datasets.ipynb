Entro il 20 maggio, due panda presso la riserva sono stati trovati per essere feriti, mentre la ricerca è continuata per altri due panda adulti che è andato perduto dopo il terremoto. Al 28 maggio 2008 mancava ancora un panda. Il panda mancante è stato poi trovato morto sotto le macerie di un recinto. Mao Mao Mao Mao, nove anni, madre di cinque anni nel centro di allevamento, è stata scoperta lunedì, il suo corpo schiacciato da un muro nel suo recinto. I detentori di panda e altri lavoratori hanno messo i suoi resti in una piccola cassa di legno e l' hanno seppellita fuori dal centro di allevamento.\",\n",

Gli esperti stanno rivedendo il progetto, ha detto la commissione. Per limitare le proteste, i funzionari hanno spinto i genitori a firmare un documento che vietava loro di organizzare proteste in cambio di denaro, ma alcuni che si rifiutavano di firmare sono stati minacciati. Gli importi dei pagamenti variavano da scuola a scuola, ma erano all\\' incirca gli stessi.

It was also very painful to extract---it took over an hour of a scalpel and tweezers in my arm before it finally came out. I understand that I may have had an especially bad experience with this, but be warned that it&#039;s possible. This implant is amazing if you want to be sick and suicidal. And also if you love the sight and sound of your own blood dripping into a metal pan because the nurse did not anticipate it to be so difficult to remove.\"',\n",

       "  '\"I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn\\'t get pregnant so I\\'m very pleased! Highly recommend\"',\n",

I\\'m good with pain however I nearly fainted with insertion, couldn\\'t belive how painful it was; the doctor did say it is very painful for some. Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I\\'m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I\\'m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods. I\\'d recommend this 100% to somebody who doesn\\'t already have heavy painful periods but right now it just isn\\'t for me\"',\n",

It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn\\'t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz.\"',\n",

You dumped this drug in the Dr\\'s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don\\'t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don\\'t need this drug- DON\\'T START. Seriously.\"'],\n",

I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don\\'t care to eat; it\\'s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don\\'t know if I\\'ve lost weight (I don\\'t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I\\'m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.\"',\n",

Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn\\'t get pregnant so I\\'m very pleased! Highly recommend\"',\n",

Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I\\'m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I\\'m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods.

I would have to say that it took a good 2.5 months to start seeing noticeable improvement with continued improvement the longer I use it. On a side note I would like to add that my ears would flush when triggered by heat or stress and so I started to use Metrogel on them and it has helped reduce the flushing.

       " '\"My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday. The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels – non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nOn Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nOn Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject. All in all it was not a pleasant chore but a fair price to pay to get the job done.\"',\n",

It worked, but my only problem with it was that it made her period a little late so that whole time we were just wondering if it didn\\'t work. It still worked tho, regardless of some of the comments saying Plan-B was better. In retrospect I would\\'ve just gotten Plan-B for the extra $10 for the more positive assurance.\"',\n",

My neurologist has tried many medications, and finally Cambia! Cambia is by far the best thing I have used- If I can take it as soon as I feel the migraine coming on, it works great! I have been taking it for 6 months, and only a couple of times it didn\\'t work. I also started taking 400mg of magnesium glycinate every day and I feel it has also helped in migraine prevention. Hope this helps others as much as it has helped me!\"',\n",

(I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn\\'t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That\\'s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven\\'t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it\\'s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it\\'s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!\"',\n",

Now, I eat small amounts of healthy foods that taste so good to me and dont make me feel sick.  Foods I used to eat now make me nauseous.  I have plenty of energy. Small amounts now give a full feeling.  I enjoy slow eating now and all the tastes.  I got dry mouth at first but now don\\'t as I drink water like everyone says you should.  Only now I enjoy it.  I was irritable the first two weeks but think that was the caffeine withdrawal.  No longer need a secret sugar or pasta fix either.  Lost 12 pounds first two weeks.  Each day losing 1-3 pounds.\"',\n",

I had been taking Seasonale birth control pills without a break after the third month and not having a period for the past 4 years.  I am in the military and deploying without having to worry about taking along 6 months worth of birth control and menstruation products is a HUGE relief.  I had some cramping after the insertion but took two OTC pain relievers and haven\\'t felt anything since.  I\\'ve run miles with it in, I\\'ve done push-ups and sit-ups and not felt a thing.

I had no sign of a period at all for over a week and a half. I woke up everyday freaking out! Yesterday I got spotting and then my mind raced and I googled everything!

Mind you before having him my periods were \"normal.\" After having him, my period was EXTREMELY heavy lasting 5 to 7 days. I was going through 3 and 4 super pads WITH super tampons. I used with it each day until the last day. It was horrible! That lasted for a year because I breastfed.

Zoloft helped take the edge off but it gave me sexual side effects and kind of made me numb. Pristiq is the best thing ever. I noticed almost immediately that it was working. The first week was rough and I felt a little more anxious. The only side effects I have are like at night I sometimes see halos around lights and I urinate a lot more often.

When Harvoni became available it was like a huge blessing, I was so grateful for the chance to get rid of HepC.

I suffer from chronic severe migraines possibly hormone related and although in the beginning they got a lot worse, after one year on the pill my migraines have reduced to almost non-existent. I also suffer from PCOS and saw dramatic improvement with my periods. They became lighter and always on their time, whereas before the pill I used to bleed 2-3 times per month. However, this pill is not a panacea and it is definitely not harmless. My libido has reduced, I  too experience the occasional paranoia and extreme irritability, my cholesterol and triglycerides have risen although I follow a balanced diet and exercise but I did not gain any weight.
